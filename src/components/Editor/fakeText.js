### Thursday - March 01st ###
- **3:00 p.m.** - _Presentation Rehearsal #3_: Demo <br>
  For the third presentation rehearsal
  you should incorporate a demo of your live application at the end of your talk.
  Your presentation structure should be more or less the same,
  but you should make adjustments based on feedback from the previous day. <br>
  [See Demo Tips](#demo-tips)

### Friday - March 02nd ###

  Finally, on Friday it's time for your final presentation.
  You will present your projects to the staff, judges and other students.

Updated Technical Requirements
------------------------------

You app must:

1. **Use Express** as a foundation.
2. **Use Mongoose** for models and database communication.
3. **Have 3 models _or more_**.
   Having one for users is a no-brainer.
   The other two should represent the main functionality of your app.
   Don't force it if having a 3rd model doesn't make sense.
4. **Have validation on its models** with feedback for users
   if their submission is invalid.
5. **Include sign up, log in & log out functionality**
   with encrypted passwords (or social logins)
   and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
6. **Have routes for all of CRUD** for models other than users.
   There should create, read, update and delete features
   even if they aren't all for the same model.
7. **Have a repo on GitHub**.
8. Have at least **1 commit per day** that you worked on it.
9. **Be deployed online** using Heroku, so anybody could use your app.
   so if you are using Facebook login, do not forget to provide the politics doc
   in order to make your app public **or your login won't work**

Responsive design **is not a requirement**. <br>
Wireframes or Mockups **are not a requirement**. <br>
Controllers **are not a requirement**. <br>
Extremly modularity **is not a requirement**. <br>
Order datamodel **is not a requirement**. <br>
Environment Variables **are not a requirement**. <br>


Updated Deliverables
--------------------

- A **working full-stack application, built by you** that runs on a server.
- A **deploy of your app** on Heroku.
- The URL of the **GitHub repository** for your app.
- The URL of the **live app on the Internet**.
- The URL of the **slides for your app's presentation**.
- You must present your app during Project #2 final presentations
  (last day of Project #2 time).

Wireframes **are not a deliverable**. <br>
User stories **are not a deliverable**.


Presentations
-------------

Project #2's presentation will focus mostly on your project.
You **won't** have to talk much about yourself or your background.
You should still **introduce yourself briefly**.

### Format ###
- Talking with Slides: **2 minutes**
- Demo: **3 minutes**
- Total: **5 minutes**

### Attire ###
- Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations
  (last day of each project's time).
- Dress at least **one degree more elegantly** than you usually dress for class.
- _Examples_:
  * If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
  * If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
  * If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.

### Slide Applications ###
- All presentations will be done **from a staff member's computer**,
  so **your slides need to be online**.
- PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind **will not be accepted**.
- Suggested online slide applications:
  * [Slides](https://slides.com/)
  * [Prezi](https://prezi.com/)
  * [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)


### Short Presentation Structure ###

1. **Title Slide** (1 slide): your project's name & your name
2. **Project Elevator Pitch** (1-2 slides):
    * What is your project?
    * How will it work?
    * Why did you choose it?
3. **Closing Slide** (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a _"Thank You"_
4. **Total**: 3-4 slides


### Final Presentation Structure ###

1. **Title Slide** (1 slide): your project's name & your name
2. **Project Elevator Pitch** (1-2 slides):
    * What is your project?
    * How does it work?
    * Why did you choose it?
3. **Technical Challenge** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the most important** technical challenge you faced?
    * How did you overcome that challenge?
4. **Big Mistake** (1-2 slides):
    * What was **the biggest** mistake you made during this project?
    * What did you learn from it?
5. **Demo Slide** (1 slide): literally says "DEMO"
   with **a link** to your project so you can open it easily
6. **Closing Slide** (1 slide): your project's name, your name & a _"Thank You"_
7. **Total**: 6-9 slides

#### Presentation Structure Notes ####
- **Don't** include a slide just for the technologies.
- **Don't** include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
- **Don't** include a slide for GitHub graphs.
- **Don't** go into detail about how the app works.
  Your demo is where you want to do that.
- If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation,
  feel free to do so.
  This suggested structure is mostly for people who don't know what to do.


### Demo Tips ###

1. Plan what you are going to demo and **practice it on the live site**.
   That way you won't be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
2. **Deploy early** so you can squash bugs.
   There are _always_ bugs on the live site at first.
3. Add **link to your live project** to your DEMO slide
   so you can start it smoothly.
4. Your app's colors and sizing **might look different on the projector**.
   If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
5. If you app is on Heroku, **refresh it before you present**.
   Otherwise there will be a delay on the initial load.


Grading Criteria (same as on platform)
--------------------------------------
- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something engaging and playable to the end user?

- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming?

- **Deployment**: Did you deploy your application to a public URL using GitHub Pages?

- **Total**: Your instructor (BlisS) will give you a total score on your project between:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | Does not meet expectations.
**1** | Meets expectations. Good job!
**2** | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!
